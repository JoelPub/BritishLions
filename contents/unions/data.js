        "description": "<p>The WRU have been the guardians of Wales's national sport since 1881. A group of 11 clubs - Swansea, Lampeter, Llandeilo, Cardiff, Newport, Llanelli, Merthyr, Llandovery, Brecon, Pontypool and Bangor - came together at the Castle Hotel, Neath on 12th March 1881, to form the Welsh Rugby Football Union. The first Triple Crown came in 1893 and was the launch pad for the first 'Golden Era', when Wales dominated the world game.</p><p>The first 'Golden Era' included the first Grand Slam by any country and a record winning run of 11 games as Wales remained unbeaten between March 1907 to January 1910. When Rob Howley's side of 1999 matched that feat they did it in eight months. There were Grand Slams in 1908, 1909 and 1911, Triple Crowns in 1900, 1902, 1905, 1908, 1909 and 1911and those victories over New Zealand in 1905 and Australia in 1908. Welsh rugby had arrived as a major force in the world game.</p><p>In the modern era, the WRU as a business blends the traditional with the modern; with over 125 years of rugby tradition and heritage behind us. The benefits of the restructure of professional rugby have reaped huge rewards since 2003 with three Six Nations Grand Slams, in 2005, 2008 and 2012, and a fourth championship title in 2013</p>"
