Irish Lions, stretching all the way back to the very first Tour in 1888.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBlackheath skipper at the time Andrew Stoddart was one of the star players on that trip and also helped organise the Tour, blazing a trail for the 43 players to have donned the famous red jersey of the Lions and also worn Club&rsquo;s black and red stripes.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNowadays in the professional era, Blackheath is not the influential giant it once was but the club remains rightly proud of its history.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nJust ask Peter Brown and Mandy Allen, the married couple whose relationship with the Club stretches all the way back to the 1970s.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBrown was a former first XV player back then who hung up his playing boots in 2000.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http\:\/\/cms12.sotic.net\/rdimages\/lions\/20170121-BlackheathvHulllIonians-HJW020.JPG\" style=\"width: 650px;

said Brown.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;Over the years Mandy and I have built up a large collection of material relating to the club&rsquo;s history.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;I feel very honoured to have played alongside internationals like Tony Jorden, Peter Bell and Mike Bulpitt as well as countless other top players.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;We got to compete against some of the best clubs in England and Wales.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;But, as in any club, it is the people who are important and Blackheath has been lucky to have had many devoted members who have become lifelong friends.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"\/\/cms12.sotic.net\/rdimages\/lions\/BlackheathvEsheatRectoryField.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;

Association Football and Rugby.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBut Blackheath has left an indelible mark on the sport in many other ways: it was a founder member of the RFU, a co-organiser of the first-ever international match and a host to many more at the Rectory Field, its home from 1883 until just last year.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt also holds the record for the most international caps gained by its players prior to the professional era starting in 1995.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe list of Blackheath Lions from 1888-1910 is too numerous to detail everyone here but CH &lsquo;Cherry&rsquo; Pillman probably warrants a name-check.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"\/\/cms12.sotic.net\/rdimages\/lions\/EngvIreland1890atRectoryField(002).jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 572px;\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nA revolutionary flanker who is said to have inspired the modern day back-row forward &ndash;

We learned how to handle ourselves during that period,&rdquo; added Green.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&ldquo;He changed things, up until that point we would have been expected to lose against the bigger teams, but that all changed with Dai.
